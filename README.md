Alternative PhpMyAdmin Themes.

Getting bored with your phpmyadmin themes? yes, there are no better themes for now until Pmahomme and Fallen comes.
Still not satisfy with those themes?

    $ cd phpmyadmin/themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/dedenbangkit/dedensky.git
    
  add this line to config.inc.php
    $cfg['ThemeDefault']        = 'dedensky';

Now you are less geek than other eyeglass users.
